        header: Consider the utilisation of the Alternating Bit Protocol to transfer
            15000 bytes of data. Both hosts are connected via a 1 Gbps link and there
            is a delay of 2 msec between the two hosts. The sender sends data frames
            that are 12000 bits long. Assuming that the retransmission timer is set
            to 10 msec, how long does it take to transfer the 15000 bytes if the third
            data frame is lost ?
