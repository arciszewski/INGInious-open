# INGInious-open

This repository contains new exercises for the third edition of the open-source [Computer Networking: Principles, Protocols and Practice](http://cnp3book.info.ucl.ac.be) ebook that use INGInious scripts to ask open or parametrised questions to the students. Some of these exercises are available on [INGINIOUS](https://inginious.org) at [https://inginious.org/course/cnp3](https://inginious.org/course/cnp3) 

These exercises are covered by a GPL license.

Ideas and suggestions for new exercises are welcome. Future revisions of this README file will include an explanation on how to create such open exercises.
