            Consider an implementation of the alternating bit protocol that is used on between two hosts that are connected via a direct link that has a bandwidth of 100 kbps. This link has a propagation delay of 1 msec.
            If the data frames are 10,000 bits long and the control frames 100 bits long, what is the maximum throughput achieved by this protocol expressed in bytes/sec?
